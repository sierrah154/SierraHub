Testing grounds for GitHub tools and functions. (New to GitHub)
I am currently enrolled in an online Data Analytics Bootcamp through UC Berkeley Extension. I have a B.S. in Environmental Science, with an emphasis in Natural Resources and a minor in Water Science. My goal is to apply any knowledge I obtain from the bootcamp to kickstart a career as an Environmental Data Analyst. Furthermore, I would like work with community outreach programs and/or natural-resource management.
